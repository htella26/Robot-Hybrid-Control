# Nonlinear 2-DOF Manipulator Control

This repository contains simulations and control implementations for a **2-DOF manipulator** operating in the **xz-plane under gravity**. The controllers are designed to achieve precise position and force tracking for various tasks, including trajectory tracking, hybrid control, force regulation, and surface adaptation.

## Features

### ðŸš€ Nonlinear 2-DOF Position Control
- Simulated a **2-DOF manipulator controller** in the **xz-plane under gravity**.
- Achieved **Â±0.05 units accuracy** in tracking a **sinusoidal endpoint trajectory** with a period of **5 seconds**.
- Utilized a **switching matrix-based position controller**.

### âš¡ Nonlinear 2-DOF Hybrid Control
- Integrated **position and force control** to achieve **precise sinusoidal motion** (Â±0.05 units) along a surface.
- Maintained **constant perpendicular force** (Â±0.1 units), ensuring **stability and adaptability**.

### ðŸŽ¯ Nonlinear 2-DOF Force Control
- Designed a **force control system** to maintain a **10-unit force** on a **horizontal surface**.
- Achieved **steady-state response** within **2 oscillation cycles** using a **stiffness constant of 1000**.

### ðŸ›  Surface Switching Control
- Developed a **surface-adaptive controller** for **2-DOF** to handle **transitions across composite surfaces**.
- Managed a **30Â° inclined wedge**, ensuring **force deviations remain under 5%**.
